# PC-Security-Checker
*Checks the current users, startup programs and malwares using the Windows' netplwiz, redgedit and mrt tools - No external program, compiler or IDE required (just notepad)*

## How to use it?

if you don't have any IDE, open notepad (by default on Windows) and paste the code in. Save the file with .vbs file extension. If you use the french version, be sure to save the file with ANSI encoding (in the bottom of the explorer dialog box). Then, double-click on the file to open it, and let the script check your PC security. Many Pop-up explaining every step to you will appear, dont worry - that's normal.
